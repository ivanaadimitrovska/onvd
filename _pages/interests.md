        I have always been interested in things from different fields.
        One of them that I was very dedicated to was playing the piano.
        I was delighted with every whistling note. Participating in numerous
        concerts and competitions brought me great experience, as well as the
        pleasure of being part of such events, which enriched my culture.
        I have also always loved public and stage performances,
        so I had tried my hand as a host during concerts.
        The years spent in elementary music school passed me by very quickly,
        because music only took me to another parallel universe, where time passed by the minute.
        I also love listening to classical music other than pop and rock music.

     Besides, I love dancing, I did hip-hop a few years ago. Hard work and hard work have 
     resulted in numerous awards. It was completely different from classical music, of course when 
     I played the piano, but I love every type of music. Ballet was another area that caught my attention.
     I did that for a while and I really did it with great love, especially when we performed the play "Swan Lake" on stage.
     These are moments I will never forget. But the icing on the cake is definitely writing for me. It is something that takes me 
     to another world, filled with all the beauties that surround us here. A winning combination for me is listening to classical music 
     and writing. I especially like writing prose, although writing poetry also gives me a special meaning.

    Sport has never been my strong point, but I especially love skiing. I have been enjoying it since I was four years old.
    The pleasure was mine every winter, together with my grandfather, and now I want to visit ski resorts where I have not been. 
    I also practiced tennis and that was one of the many things that caught my attention.

        Apart from writing, I enjoy reading books. The book fair was my favorite place, from where I always went out with a purchased book. Just reading books takes me away from         reality, I just live another life.
