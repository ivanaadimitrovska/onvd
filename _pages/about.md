      My name is Ivana Dimitrovska, I am twenty years old. I was born on January 28, 2001, in Bitola. I finished high school at the high school "Josip Broz Tito" in Bitola. I am currently studying information science, but my love for writing has always reigned in me. Ever since I was a child, I wrote songs in elementary school, and then my greatest pleasure was writing written works in Macedonian language and literature. Apart from writing, art was also expressed in music. I went to music school for six years and played the piano. I participated in numerous concerts and competitions, where as a host I always wrote my own speeches. I have also been a guest on several television shows related to my achievements in the field of dance. I have taken part in a short film, prepared by the Red Cross, as well as in the drama section of my high school. I always had the idea to write a beautiful book, but time and responsibilities did not allow me to do so. Now was the right time. As I wrote my novel, I enjoyed every word written. Although I have previously written a large number of texts, seminar and as I mentioned written compositions, this was the first major work, of course in order to be realized. Reading books has always been my hobby as well as relaxation. I hope that others will be able to share the same, if they have my book in their hands.
