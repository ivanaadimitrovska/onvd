Nowadays, we often forget about written books, surrounded by millions of electronic devices, social networks and technologies, which are the product of today's rapid progress. But when we take the book in our hands, reading word for word written on thin sheets of paper, we enter a world, a different reality, leaving the other side of ourselves away from problems. We taste the pleasure that comes with every read word, which not being able to get it by looking at the screens of laptops or phones. We skillfully isolate ourselves from the news, which we constantly receive from the media, knowing how to create an uncomfortable feeling in us, often followed by cramps and shivers, yet doubting whether it is true or false. From the book we cannot get that discomfort, it gives us only a different perspective on the world we live in, no matter how cruel it looks. The book gives us richness and words, which can only serve in our upgrading, gives us a different dimension, in which we unconsciously begin to dream and walk on the magic stairs, the door of which opens with each page we read from that book we hold in the hands.
